Bugger Arcade Game -- Udacity Project

This is the third project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity.


Bugger is a 'frogger' like 2-dimensional video game where the objective is to move your player across the steady stream of re-spawning enemy object or 'bugs' (moving left to right) to reach the water row of bricks. The player moves brick by brick, the enemies move steadily. Each time the player reaches the water, it re-spawns at the original starting brick.

How to run the game:
Download the repository in your desktop, unzip it, then open the "index.html" file in your browser to play
the game.


Udacity's instructions:

You will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

1. If you need a refresher on Object Oriented JavaScript, review our course and OOJS Notes; if you'd like a 2. more detailed explanation as to how the game engine works, see our HTML5 Canvas course.
2. Read the detailed instructions for the project.
3. Download the art assets and provided game engine.
4. Review the video of the completed game and take note of the game's rules.
5. Review the code and comments provided in app.js
6. Identify the various classes you will need to write.
7. Identify and code the properties each class must have to accomplish its tasks.
8. Write the functions that provide functionality to each of your class instances.

The work for this project was done in the "app.js" file. Because this was an object oriented programming course, the work to be finished was the creation of the Player and Enemy classes through the use of constructor objects and prototype manipulation, then using the appropriate level of inheritance in order to assure that no code was duplicated.
